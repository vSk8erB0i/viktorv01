                I’m a digital creator and engineering student specializing in Virtual Environments and Digital Business, currently based in León, Mexico. I am passionate about technology, design, and how immersive experiences can improve people's lives.

                My work blends web development, 3D modeling, interactive design, and multimedia production. I’ve collaborated on VR projects focused on mental health, and I’ve worked as a digital content creator for local companies, managing photography, video production, and visual storytelling.

                Beyond tech, I find joy in learning new languages and discovering how they shape cultures and ways of thinking. I'm also deeply passionate about music and I enjoy reading fiction, philosophy, classics. These interests inspire many of my creative and educational projects.
